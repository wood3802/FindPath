# FindPath

  I wrote these functions as part of my application to Paradox Games. A 2D map is represented using a 1D array of 1s and 0s.
1s are passable spaces while 0s are impassable. The function returns the length of the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
It also populates a buffer with the indices of the shortest path, including the end point but not including the starting point.
